SWMM with Enhanced Control Rules 

Changes to the EPA SWMM software were developed by employees at EmNet, LLC, South Bend, IN. The intention of this software is to improve the control rules to allow for more sophisticated control scenarios. The modified control rules are licensed under the BSD-2 permissive free software license. This open source software is provided with the intention for contribution back to the official EPA SWMM release. Please look at the examples and instructions to learn more about how to take advantage of the modified control rules.

Excerpts reproduced from the EPA SWMM 5 website: 

"SWMM is a dynamic hydrology-hydraulic water quality simulation model. It is used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas. The runoff component operates on a collection of sub catchment areas that receive precipitation and generate runoff and pollutant loads. The routing portion transports this runoff through a system of pipes, channels, storage/treatment devices, pumps, and regulators....SWMM tracks the quantity and quality of runoff made within each sub catchment. It tracks the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period made up of multiple time steps. SWMM 5 has recently been extended to model the hydrologic performance of specific types of low impact development (LID) controls....Running under Windows, SWMM 5 provides an integrated environment for editing study area input data; running hydrologic, hydraulic and water quality simulations; and viewing the results in a variety of formats."

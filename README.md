SWMM with Enhanced Control Rules

This software was originally developed by employees at EmNet, LLC, 121 S. Niles Ave., Ste 22, South Bend, IN, 46617. The intention of this software is to improve the control rules to allow for more sophisticated control scenarios. This software is currently licensed under LGPL but is intended to contribute back to the official EPA SWMM some day. Please look at the wiki to understand how to use the control rules.
